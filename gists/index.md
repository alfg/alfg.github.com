### Code Gists

My collection of scripts and pieces of code I've written or modified that
may be useful for others. All code gists are maintained and versioned on
[Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/alfg), so feel free to clone, fork
or share. :)

<hr />
      
* [datawatch.py](/gists/datawatch.html) - Polls a MongoDB collection for new
data inserted and sends an email notice.
* [purge_s3_objects.py](/gists/purge_s3_objects.html) - Purges old objects/files
stored on Amazon S3 based on date specified.
* [.gitconfig](/gists/gitconfig.html) - My .gitconfig file to make `git diff`, 
`git branch`, and `git status` much more readable.
