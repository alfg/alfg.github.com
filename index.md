![Alfred Gutierrez](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/922ef4d7e597243ff0de75bdfea9b424.png?size=200)

Hello, my name is Alfred.  I am currently a Staff Software Engineer at [Fandango](http://fandango.com), working on [FandangoNOW](http://fandangonow.com) in content packaging, delivery and DRM as well as playback experience.

I write software mostly for the web, and I am well-versed in Javascript/Node, Python, C# and Go.

I also specialize in frontend & microservices architecture, and video & audio technologies.

I'm always working on side projects in the evenings. You can check out more of my recent <a href="projects.html">side projects</a> and open-source software on
<a href="http://github.com/alfg">Github</a>.

I have strong views in minimalistic design & architecture. I value modular, minimal, and well-documented code.

Some of my hobbies and interests outside of programming are gaming, building computers, video & audio hardware, cars and coffee.

You can find me on [Github](http://github.com/alfg),
[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/alfred-gutierrez/58/ba1/93b), or
[Email](mailto:alfg.g.jr@gmail.com).

I currently live in Los Angeles, CA.
