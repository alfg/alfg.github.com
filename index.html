        <h1>About me</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>Hello, my name is Alfred. I am currently a Web Developer at <a href="http://phenomenex.com">Phenomenex</a>,
         a chromatography company in the biotech field. I also worked as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer at
        <a href="http://pictage.com">Pictage</a>, a photo hosting company for professional photographers.</p>

        <p>I write software mostly for the web, with an emphasis on the frontend UI/UX. My weapons of choice are
        Python and Javascript, but I also have experience and knowledge in C#/ASP.NET, Node.js, and PHP.</p>

        <p>I'm always working on side projects in the evenings.  I'm currently working on
            <a href="http://guildbit.com">Guildbit</a>, a free, donation-based service for deploying temporary
            <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="Mumble is an open source, low-latency, high quality voice chat
            software primarily intended for use while gaming.">Mumble servers</span> so gamers can enjoy games over VOIP
            with their friends. You can check out more of my recent <a href="projects.html">side projects</a> and open-source software on
            <a href="http://github.com/alfg">Github</a>.</p>

        <p>I have strong views in minimalist design; not only for the frontend UI/UX, but also the backend code as
        well. I value modular, reusable and minimal code.</p>

        <p>Some of my hobbies and interests outside of programming are gaming, building computers, audio equipment, cars and coffee.</p>

        <p>You can find me on <a href="http://github.com/alfg">Github</a>,
            <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/alfred-gutierrez/58/ba1/93b">LinkedIn</a>, or
            <a href="mailto:alf.g.jr@gmail.com">Email</a></p>
        <p>I currently live in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
